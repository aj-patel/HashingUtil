This Project is a simple implementation of Hashing. It provides a HashUtil untility, which can be used for getting hashcode for a string.

HashCode remains same for one course of execution. If this untility class is loaded again, this will result in a different hashcode than the previous execution, however,

for the same execution, HashCode for the same string object(objects with same value) will still be the same.
